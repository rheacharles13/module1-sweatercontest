# module1-sweatercontest
Welcome to Rhea's Module 1 Project for Creative Embedded Systems (Fall 2024). I created a changing “sweater contest” display, where the color of the sweater on the human contestant alternates between different fall colors. To add an extra fall touch, I added an oak tree leaf design on the sweater!

# Materials Needed
ESP32 TTGO T-display
Lipo battery for portable power
Paper frame with cutout (fits the ESP32)
String (about 4 feet long) and popsicle stick for hanging
Tape or adhesive for securing the frame

# Running the Code
After writing your .ino code on the Arduino IDE (or opening and using my sweatercontest-rhea.ino file), press the Play button to begin compiling the code (any errors should be discovered here) and automatically uploading it to ESP32 display. Repeat this compilation process every time you alter your code!

# Setup Instructions

# Prepare the ESP32:
Load the provided code onto the ESP32 using the Arduino IDE and connect the Lipo battery.

# Prepare the frame:
Design on your paper frame as you wish (I recommend matching the theme of your fall project)! 
Fit the ESP32 snugly in the cutout of your frame so that the hole for the string is on top of the screen.
Tape the Lipo battery securely on the back of the board.
Thread the string through the pre-punched hole and knot it securely. Tape the bottom of the string to the frame.
Leave about 4 feet of open string and then spool the other end of the thread on a popsicle stick and tape it all together so the string doesn't unravel.

# Hang the Display:
Find a place to hang the project, and your fall-themed project is ready to be viewed!
