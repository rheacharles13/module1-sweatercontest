# module1-sweatercontest
Welcome to Rhea's Module 1 Project for Creative Embedded Systems (Fall 2024). I created a changing “sweater contest” display, where the color of sweater on the human contestant alternates between different fall colors. To add an extra fall touch, I added a oak tree leaf design on the sweater!
